# Stock Trading Platform (Prototype)

## Project_description
This is an unfinished stock trading platform built using Python and PyQt5 for the user interface.<br />
It is designed to provide a foundation for a modern trading application that connects with external data sources, simulates demo trades, and manages user portfolios.<br />

## Project Status
Note: This project is still in early development.<br />
The UI is incomplete, and only partial functionality has been implemented.<br /><br />

## Current implemented features:
-Basic login system (connected to user data hosted on IBM Cloud)<br />
-Stock search feature with live data pulled from Yahoo Finance<br />
-Initial portfolio management logic<br />
-Basic demo trading mode (virtual trades)<br />
-Early user management interface (add/remove/view users)<br />

## Planned / incomplete features:
-Full UI design and integration<br />
-Real-time trading API connection<br />
-Transaction history and analytics<br />
-Enhanced error handling and input validation<br />
